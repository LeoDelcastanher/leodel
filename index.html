        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 2000s child, born in the 90s influenced by the 80s. Raised between an artistic sister and a programmer
            brother, I always dreamed of being able to use everything that they taught me. When I discovered the
            Front-End`s world, I knew that my dream came true. I enjoy talking, sharing knowledge and stories. Love
            connecting all the random stuff that I learned throughout the years to solve puzzles and problems. Excellent
            worker and even better when in a team. Proactive and very creative!

        </div>

        <h4>Tech Support</h4>
        <p>This was one of my first jobs in the tech industry. It was a voluntary work, where we would receive donations
            of old computers from big companies and get them running again, achieving the minimum standards for Windows
            xp. These computers then got placed in various CDI stations across Brazil, where underprivileged kids and
            adults could have access to them and the internet.

        </div>

        <h4>Tech Support</h4>
        <p>Here is where I worked for a service company called Bonatec, that provided tech support for CIDASC. From
            fixing printers to solving tech crysis through the phone with a farmer all across the state (of Santa Catarina), I did it all.

        <h4>Quality Assurance</h4>
        <p>While having to understand the inner workings of their software so I could test them, I also created complex
            SQL queries to create charts and data sheets.

        <h4>Web Developer</h4>
        <p>I started out developing custom websites for clients, most from scratch but some using Wordpress. Later on
            it came to my responsibility to maintain an online test taking web app, where I used Javascript, Jquery and
            PHP to create a pleasant test taking experience. Always trying to help as much as I can, I started creating
            the digital banners and flyers for the company, using Adobe photoshop and illustrator.</p>

        </div>

        <h4>Front-End Developer and Designer</h4>
        <p>Here is where I learned more about Front-End, RESTful services, API and fell in love with them instantly. I
            created from the ground up a fully responsive web app with real time data analysis. Created a unique look
            and feel, the whole design of the software. It was all in javascript, using AngularJs with lots of
            different libraries (charts, data manipulation and some visual enhancers). Since the goal was to show a
            huge amount of data in a small space (specially with the size of the phone screens back then) I created
            and implemented all sorts of smart, unique, compact and practical ways of presenting them.</p>

        <h4>Front-End Developer</h4>
        <p>(CI&T bought Dextra just last year)<br>
            Here I maintain an online marketplace seller software. All in Angular (TypeScript) with its own design system.
