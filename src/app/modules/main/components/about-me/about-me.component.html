  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a Front-End developer with a very  creative set of  skills. Have over 9+ years of web development experience,
    6+ years of experience with JavaScript frameworks and RESTful Services. Have developed in the past several web apps
    from the ground up, where my responsibilities were to Develop the Front-End, Create UI, UX, and overview other Front-End colleagues.
  </p>

  <p>I am a 2000s child, born in the 90s influenced by the 80s. Raised between an artistic sister and a programmer
    brother, I always dreamed of being able to use everything that they taught me. When I discovered the
    Front-End`s world, I knew that my dream came true. I enjoy talking, sharing knowledge and stories. Love
    connecting all the random stuff that I learned throughout the years to solve puzzles and problems. Excellent
    worker and even better when in a team. Proactive and very creative!
